 # debhelp

A project to help people learn Debian. A help file contains entries with tags and associated help text. A search can be made with tags to find associated help text.

 # Syntax of help file

A tag line begins with the dollar sign ($), followed by a series of words. The words must contain only lower case letters, and the words and the dollar sign must all be separated by exactly one space. After the tag line follows any number of lines containing text aimed to help the Debian newbie, or experienced user.

 # Todo

Fill the help file. Fix autumatic download from github.

 # Contribute

New entries are added at the top of the help file. Just commit. Ah, I need to learn git

 # Important

The help file is stored at "/usr/share/debhelp.text". I have no idea if this is a good place to put it, but it was my best guess.
